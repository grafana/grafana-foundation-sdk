    # The panel plugin type id. This is used to find the plugin to display the panel.
    type_val: str

    # List of transformations that are applied to the panel data before rendering.

    # The min time interval setting defines a lower limit for the $__interval and $__interval_ms variables.

    interval: typing.Optional[str]
    # Overrides the relative time range for individual panels,

    # the dashboard time picker in the top-right corner of the dashboard. You can use this to show metrics from different
    # time periods or days on the same dashboard.
    # The value is formatted as time operation like: `now-5m` (Last 5 minutes), `now/d` (the day so far),
    # `now-5d/d`(Last 5 days), `now/w` (This week so far), `now-2y/y` (Last 2 years).
    # Note: Panel time overrides have no effect when the dashboard’s time range is absolute.

    time_from: typing.Optional[str]
    # Overrides the time range for individual panels by shifting its start and end relative to the time picker.
    # For example, you can shift the time range for the panel to be two hours earlier than the dashboard time picker setting `2h`.
    # Note: Panel time overrides have no effect when the dashboard’s time range is absolute.
