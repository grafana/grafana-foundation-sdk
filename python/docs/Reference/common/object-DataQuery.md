## Definition

```python
class DataQuery:
    """
    These are the common properties available to all queries in all datasources.
    Specific implementations will *extend* this interface, adding the required
    properties for the given context.
    """

    # A unique identifier for the query within the list of targets.
    # In server side expressions, the refId is used as a variable name to identify results.
    # By default, the UI will assign A->Z; however setting meaningful names may be useful.
    ref_id: str
    # If hide is set to true, Grafana will filter out the response(s) associated with this query before returning it to the panel.
    hide: typing.Optional[bool]
    # Specify the query flavor
    # TODO make this required and give it a default
    query_type: typing.Optional[str]
    # For mixed data sources the selected datasource is on the query level.
    # For non mixed scenarios this is undefined.
    # TODO find a better way to do this ^ that's friendly to schema
    # TODO this shouldn't be unknown but DataSourceRef | null
    datasource: typing.Optional[object]
