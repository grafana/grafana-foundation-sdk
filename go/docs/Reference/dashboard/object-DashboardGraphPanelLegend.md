```go
func (dashboardGraphPanelLegend *DashboardGraphPanelLegend) UnmarshalJSONStrict(raw []byte) error
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> Equals

Equals tests the equality of two `DashboardGraphPanelLegend` objects.

```go
func (dashboardGraphPanelLegend *DashboardGraphPanelLegend) Equals(other DashboardGraphPanelLegend) bool
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> Validate

Validate checks all the validation constraints that may be defined on `DashboardGraphPanelLegend` fields for violations and returns them.

```go
func (dashboardGraphPanelLegend *DashboardGraphPanelLegend) Validate() error
```
