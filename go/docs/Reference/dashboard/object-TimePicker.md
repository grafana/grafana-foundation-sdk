## Methods

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> UnmarshalJSONStrict

UnmarshalJSONStrict implements a custom JSON unmarshalling logic to decode `TimePicker` from JSON.

Note: the unmarshalling done by this function is strict. It will fail over required fields being absent from the input, fields having an incorrect type, unexpected fields being present, â€¦

```go
func (timePicker *TimePicker) UnmarshalJSONStrict(raw []byte) error
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> Equals

Equals tests the equality of two `TimePicker` objects.

```go
func (timePicker *TimePicker) Equals(other TimePicker) bool
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> Validate

Validate checks all the validation constraints that may be defined on `TimePicker` fields for violations and returns them.

```go
func (timePicker *TimePicker) Validate() error
```
