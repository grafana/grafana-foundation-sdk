    FolderUid *string `json:"folderUid,omitempty"`
    // The interval, in seconds, at which all rules in the group are evaluated.

## Methods

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> UnmarshalJSONStrict

UnmarshalJSONStrict implements a custom JSON unmarshalling logic to decode `RuleGroup` from JSON.

Note: the unmarshalling done by this function is strict. It will fail over required fields being absent from the input, fields having an incorrect type, unexpected fields being present, â€¦

```go
func (ruleGroup *RuleGroup) UnmarshalJSONStrict(raw []byte) error
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> Equals

Equals tests the equality of two `RuleGroup` objects.

```go
func (ruleGroup *RuleGroup) Equals(other RuleGroup) bool
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> Validate

Validate checks all the validation constraints that may be defined on `RuleGroup` fields for violations and returns them.

```go
func (ruleGroup *RuleGroup) Validate() error
```
