```go
func (pipelineMetricAggregationWithMultipleBucketPaths *PipelineMetricAggregationWithMultipleBucketPaths) UnmarshalJSONStrict(raw []byte) error
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> Equals

Equals tests the equality of two `PipelineMetricAggregationWithMultipleBucketPaths` objects.

```go
func (pipelineMetricAggregationWithMultipleBucketPaths *PipelineMetricAggregationWithMultipleBucketPaths) Equals(other PipelineMetricAggregationWithMultipleBucketPaths) bool
```
