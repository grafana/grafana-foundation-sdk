```go
func (metricAggregationWithMissingSupport *MetricAggregationWithMissingSupport) UnmarshalJSONStrict(raw []byte) error
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> Equals

Equals tests the equality of two `MetricAggregationWithMissingSupport` objects.

```go
func (metricAggregationWithMissingSupport *MetricAggregationWithMissingSupport) Equals(other MetricAggregationWithMissingSupport) bool
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> Validate

Validate checks all the validation constraints that may be defined on `MetricAggregationWithMissingSupport` fields for violations and returns them.

```go
func (metricAggregationWithMissingSupport *MetricAggregationWithMissingSupport) Validate() error
```
