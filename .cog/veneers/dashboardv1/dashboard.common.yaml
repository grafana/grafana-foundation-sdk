# This file is loaded when only dashboardv1 are present.
# Its purpose is to remove the "fieldconfig" and "options" builders leftover from the composability veneer.
# The veneer doesn't remove these builders itself because they're used by dashboardv2 composability.

language: all

package: "*"

builders:
  - omit: { by_name: Options }
  - omit: { by_name: FieldConfig }
