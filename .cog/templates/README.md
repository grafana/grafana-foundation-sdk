# Template blocks

The templates contained in this folder are used to customize the types, builders and docs generated by cog.
For example, to automatically position panels on the grid whenever they're added to a dashboard.

To achieve that, cog looks for [template blocks](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#example-Template-Block) following
a particular naming convention, and renders them.

A [list of every supported template block](https://grafana.github.io/cog/reference/template_blocks/) is available in cog's documentation.
