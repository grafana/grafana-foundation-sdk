	uid?: string;
	// Title of dashboard.
	title?: string;
	// Description of dashboard.
	description?: string;
	// This property should only be used in dashboards defined by plugins.  It is a quick check
	// to see if the version has changed since the last time.
	revision?: number;
	// ID of a dashboard imported from the https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/ portal
	gnetId?: string;
	// Tags associated with dashboard.
	tags?: string[];
	// Timezone of dashboard. Accepted values are IANA TZDB zone ID or "browser" or "utc".

	// Accepted values are 0 (sync turned off), 1 (shared crosshair), 2 (shared crosshair and tooltip).
	graphTooltip?: dashboard.DashboardCursorSync;
	// Time range for dashboard.
	// Accepted values are relative time strings like {from: 'now-6h', to: 'now'} or absolute time strings like {from: '2020-07-10T08:00:00.000Z', to: '2020-07-10T14:00:00.000Z'}.
	time?: {

	// The month that the fiscal year starts on.  0 = January, 11 = December
	fiscalYearStartMonth?: number;
	// When set to true, the dashboard will redraw panels at an interval matching the pixel width.
	// This will keep data "moving left" regardless of the query refresh rate. This setting helps
	// avoid dashboards presenting stale live data

	// Day when the week starts. Expressed by the name of the day in lowercase, e.g. "monday".
	weekStart?: string;
	// Refresh rate of dashboard. Represented via interval string, e.g. "5s", "1m", "1h", "1d".

		list?: dashboard.VariableModel[];
	};

	// Annotations are used to overlay event markers and overlay event tags on graphs.
	// Grafana comes with a native annotation store and the ability to add annotation events directly from the graph panel or via the HTTP API.
	// See https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/annotate-visualizations/
	annotations: dashboard.AnnotationContainer;
	// Links with references to other dashboards or external websites.
