# <span class="badge object-type-class"></span> DataQuery

These are the common properties available to all queries in all datasources.

Specific implementations will *extend* this interface, adding the required

properties for the given context.

## Definition

```php
class DataQuery implements \JsonSerializable
{
    /**
     * A unique identifier for the query within the list of targets.
     * In server side expressions, the refId is used as a variable name to identify results.
     * By default, the UI will assign A->Z; however setting meaningful names may be useful.
     */
    public string $refId;

    /**
     * If hide is set to true, Grafana will filter out the response(s) associated with this query before returning it to the panel.
     */
    public ?bool $hide;

    /**
     * Specify the query flavor
     * TODO make this required and give it a default
     */
    public ?string $queryType;

    /**
     * For mixed data sources the selected datasource is on the query level.
     * For non mixed scenarios this is undefined.
     * TODO find a better way to do this ^ that's friendly to schema
     * TODO this shouldn't be unknown but DataSourceRef | null
     * @var mixed|null
     */
    public $datasource;

}
```
