# <span class="badge builder"></span> DataQueryBuilder

## Constructor

```php
new DataQueryBuilder()
```
## Methods

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> build

Builds the object.

```php
build()
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> datasource

For mixed data sources the selected datasource is on the query level.

For non mixed scenarios this is undefined.

TODO find a better way to do this ^ that's friendly to schema

TODO this shouldn't be unknown but DataSourceRef | null

@param mixed $datasource

```php
datasource($datasource)
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> hide

If hide is set to true, Grafana will filter out the response(s) associated with this query before returning it to the panel.

```php
hide(bool $hide)
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> queryType

Specify the query flavor

TODO make this required and give it a default

```php
queryType(string $queryType)
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> refId

A unique identifier for the query within the list of targets.

In server side expressions, the refId is used as a variable name to identify results.

By default, the UI will assign A->Z; however setting meaningful names may be useful.

```php
refId(string $refId)
```
