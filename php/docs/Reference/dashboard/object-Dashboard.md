## Methods

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> fromArray

Builds this object from an array.

This function is meant to be used with the return value of `json_decode($json, true)`.

```php
static fromArray(array $inputData)
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> jsonSerialize

Returns the data representing this object, preparing it for JSON serialization with `json_encode()`.

```php
jsonSerialize()
```

## Examples

### Encoding to JSON

```php
use Grafana\Foundation\Dashboard\Dashboard;

require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$dashboard = new Dashboard(
    uid: 'sample-dashboard-uid',
    title: 'Sample dashboard',
);

echo(json_encode($dashboard, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT).PHP_EOL);
```

### Decoding from JSON

```php
use Grafana\Foundation\Dashboard\Dashboard;

require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$dashboardJSON = file_get_contents(__DIR__.'/dashboard.json');

$dashboard = Dashboard::fromArray(json_decode($dashboardJSON, true));

var_dump($dashboard);
```
