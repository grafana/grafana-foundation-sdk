# <span class="badge builder"></span> DataqueryBuilder

## Constructor

```java
new DataqueryBuilder()
```
## Methods

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> build

Builds the object.

```java
public Dataquery build()
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> datasource

For mixed data sources the selected datasource is on the query level.

For non mixed scenarios this is undefined.

TODO find a better way to do this ^ that's friendly to schema

TODO this shouldn't be unknown but DataSourceRef | null

```java
public DataqueryBuilder datasource(DataSourceRef datasource)
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> hide

true if query is disabled (ie should not be returned to the dashboard)

Note this does not always imply that the query should not be executed since

the results from a hidden query may be used as the input to other queries (SSE etc)

```java
public DataqueryBuilder hide(Boolean hide)
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> panelId

Panel ID from wich the queries will be reused.

```java
public DataqueryBuilder panelId(Integer panelId)
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> refId

A unique identifier for the query within the list of targets.

In server side expressions, the refId is used as a variable name to identify results.

By default, the UI will assign A->Z; however setting meaningful names may be useful.

```java
public DataqueryBuilder refId(String refId)
```
