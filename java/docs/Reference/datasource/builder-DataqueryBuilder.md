## Methods

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> build

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> datasource

For mixed data sources the selected datasource is on the query level.

For non mixed scenarios this is undefined.

TODO find a better way to do this ^ that's friendly to schema

TODO this shouldn't be unknown but DataSourceRef | null

```java
public DataqueryBuilder datasource(DataSourceRef datasource)
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> hide

If hide is set to true, Grafana will filter out the response(s) associated with this query before returning it to the panel.

```java
public DataqueryBuilder hide(Boolean hide)
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> panelId

Panel ID from wich the queries will be reused.

```java
public DataqueryBuilder panelId(Integer panelId)
```

### <span class="badge object-method"></span> refId

A unique identifier for the query within the list of targets.

In server side expressions, the refId is used as a variable name to identify results.

By default, the UI will assign A->Z; however setting meaningful names may be useful.

```java
public DataqueryBuilder refId(String refId)
```
